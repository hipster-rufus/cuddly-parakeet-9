## Installation
To install my project, you will need to clone my repository from GitHub onto a local directory by entering this code into your terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/hipster-rufus/cuddly-parakeet-9.git`

## Usage
Once the repo has been cloned, run the program through your terminal: `node index.js`.
This will prompt a series of questions which will populate your new README.md. Once every question has been answered, your markdown file will generate and save into the same folder, ready to go!
